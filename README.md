Following [this tutorial](https://www.firstgraphics.app/) from [IRE](http://www.ire.org/) and [NICAR](http://data.nicar.org/) training sessions, I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS within a Node.js framework to create and publish a standalone page with interactive graphics on the high homicide rate in the South Los Angeles neighborhood of Harvard Park.
